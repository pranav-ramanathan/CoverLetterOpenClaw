Hiring Manager  
Mewburn Ellis

Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to apply for the **Summer Internship – Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (Manchester)** at Mewburn Ellis. I am currently a BSc Mathematics student at Queen Mary University of London (predicted First Class), and I’ve built practical AI systems across research and production environments, with a strong focus on reliability, speed, and measurable outcomes.

As Co-Founder at Humanaize, I architected and deployed a real-time multilingual voice AI platform on AWS using Docker, RAG-based retrieval, and low-latency streaming infrastructure. In prior roles, I developed multi-document RAG systems that reduced response time from 30 seconds to 0.5 seconds and cut inference costs by over 95% through model/infrastructure optimisation. During my STRIDE research internship at QMUL, I benchmarked transformer and reinforcement learning methods against classical optimisation methods, publishing first-author work with rigorous evaluation methodology.

I’m particularly drawn to Mewburn Ellis because of your focus on deep technology domains and the opportunity to work where cutting-edge AI/ML innovation meets real-world commercial and strategic impact. I would bring a blend of mathematical grounding, hands-on ML engineering, and clear communication to support high-quality technical analysis and contribute effectively as part of your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and interests align with this internship.

Sincerely,  
Pranav Ramanathan
