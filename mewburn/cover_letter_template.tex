Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the \textbf{Summer Internship -- Artificial Intelligence \& Machine Learning (Manchester)} at Mewburn Ellis. I am a BSc Mathematics student at Queen Mary University of London (predicted First Class), with hands-on AI experience across research and production.

At Humanaize, I helped architect a multilingual real-time voice AI platform using retrieval-augmented generation and low-latency streaming. Previously, I built multi-document AI workflows that reduced response time from 30 seconds to 0.5 seconds and cut inference costs by over 95\%.

I am particularly drawn to Mewburn Ellis because of the opportunity to work at the intersection of advanced technology and commercial impact. I would bring strong quantitative problem-solving, practical engineering execution, and clear communication to your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application further.

Sincerely,\\[0.4cm]
Pranav Ramanathan
