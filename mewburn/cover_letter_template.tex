\begin{letter}{Hiring Manager\\Mewburn Ellis}

\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I am writing to apply for the \textbf{Summer Internship -- Artificial Intelligence \& Machine Learning (Manchester)} at Mewburn Ellis. I am currently pursuing a BSc in Mathematics at Queen Mary University of London (predicted First Class), and I have hands-on experience delivering AI systems in both research and production settings.

In my recent work, I designed and deployed real-time AI systems using modern ML and cloud tooling. At Humanaize, I helped architect a multilingual voice AI platform using retrieval-augmented generation and low-latency streaming infrastructure. Previously, I built multi-document AI workflows that reduced response time from 30 seconds to 0.5 seconds and cut inference costs by over 95\% through model and infrastructure optimisation.

I am particularly drawn to Mewburn Ellis because of the opportunity to work at the intersection of advanced technology and meaningful commercial impact. I would bring strong quantitative problem-solving, practical engineering execution, and clear communication to support your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application further.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
