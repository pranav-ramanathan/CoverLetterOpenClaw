Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the \textbf{Summer Internship -- Artificial Intelligence \& Machine Learning (Manchester, 29 June--3 July 2026)} at Mewburn Ellis. I am a BSc Mathematics student at Queen Mary University of London (predicted First Class), graduating in 2026, and I am keen to begin a professional role in the next 12--18 months.

I am particularly motivated by this internship because it combines exactly what I enjoy: deep technical thinking in AI/ML, clear analytical writing, and practical commercial impact. The opportunity to learn directly from experienced patent attorneys, understand how patent law is applied in fast-moving AI/ML fields, and gain hands-on exposure to drafting, prosecution, and strategic advisory work is exactly the environment I am looking for.

In my recent work, I have built and evaluated AI systems across research and industry settings. At Humanaize, I helped architect a multilingual real-time voice AI platform using retrieval-augmented generation and low-latency streaming. I have also optimised multi-document AI workflows from 30 seconds to 0.5 seconds while reducing inference costs by over 95\%. Alongside technical depth, these projects strengthened my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly, work independently, and collaborate effectively.

I would value the chance to contribute to your Manchester programme and learn from Mewburn Ellis' AI/ML team at the intersection of intellectual property and emerging technology.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application.

Sincerely,\\[0.4cm]
Pranav Ramanathan
