Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the \textbf{Summer Internship -- Artificial Intelligence \& Machine Learning (Manchester)} at Mewburn Ellis. I am a BSc Mathematics student at Queen Mary University of London (predicted First Class), with practical AI experience across both research and production environments.

What appeals to me most about this internship is the chance to work close to genuine innovation and learn how complex technical ideas are translated into clear, commercially meaningful outcomes. I enjoy moving between deep technical detail and plain-language explanation, and I am keen to develop that further in a professional setting where careful analysis and communication matter.

In recent roles, I have worked on real-time AI systems, including architecting a multilingual voice AI platform and optimising multi-document workflows from 30 seconds to 0.5 seconds while reducing inference costs by over 95\%. Alongside strong quantitative problem-solving, I would bring disciplined execution, curiosity, and a collaborative approach to your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application further.

Sincerely,\\[0.4cm]
Pranav Ramanathan
